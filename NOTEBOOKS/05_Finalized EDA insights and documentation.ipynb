    "\n",
    "Provide lifestyle and preventive care counseling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement early symptom management education.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7️⃣ Frequent Hospital Visitors Show Increased Risk\n",
    "\n",
    "Patients with higher total hospital visits demonstrate healthcare dependency patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Action:\n",
    "\n",
    "Enroll frequent visitors in chronic disease management programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Provide lifestyle and preventive care counseling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement early symptom management education.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8️⃣ No Strong Single Predictor Exists\n",
    "\n",
    "Correlation heatmap suggests readmission risk is influenced by multiple moderate factors rather than one dominant variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Action:\n",
    "\n",
    "Develop a composite risk scoring system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Combine stay duration, medication load, diagnoses, and visit history into one risk index.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use multi-factor risk assessment before discharge.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9️⃣ Elderly Patients Show Slightly Higher Readmission Trend\n",
    "\n",
    "Age-based segmentation indicates older patients require more monitoring.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Action:\n",
    "\n",
    "Design elderly-specific discharge protocols.\n",
    "\n",
    "Arrange caregiver involvement during discharge.\n",
    "\n",
    "Schedule early geriatric follow-ups.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔟 Insulin Treatment Reflects Severity\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Action:\n",
    "\n",
    "Provide structured glucose monitoring plan before discharge\n",
    "\n",
    "Schedule early follow-up within 7 days\n",
    "\n",
    "Offer insulin administration counseling\n",
    "\n",
