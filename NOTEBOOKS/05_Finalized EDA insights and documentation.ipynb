    "## 1 — TOP 10 FINAL INSIGHTS\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Hospital Stay Duration Significantly Impacts Readmission:\n",
    "\n",
    "Statistical tests (T-test & ANOVA) confirm that patients with longer hospital stays are more likely to be readmitted.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Action:\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement enhanced discharge planning for patients staying more than 7 days.\n",
    "\n",
    "Schedule mandatory follow-up within 3–7 days post-discharge.\n",
    "\n",
    "Introduce discharge readiness assessment scoring for long-stay patients.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Readmitted Patients Show Higher Median Hospital Stay:\n",
    "\n",
    "Boxplot analysis indicates slightly higher stay duration among <30 and >30 readmission groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Action:\n",
    "\n",
    "Flag patients with above-median hospital stay for additional monitoring.\n",
    "\n",
    "Provide structured discharge education before release.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensure medication reconciliation is completed properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Gender Is Not a Significant Predictor:\n",
    "\n",
    "Chi-square test (p = 0.214) shows no strong association between gender and readmission.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Action:\n",
    "\n",
    "Avoid designing gender-based intervention strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Focus healthcare resources on clinical severity indicators instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Action:\n",
    "\n",
    "Flag patients with above-median hospital stay for additional monitoring.\n",
    "\n",
    "Provide structured discharge education before release.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensure medication reconciliation is completed properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Long-Stay Patients Represent High-Risk Group:\n",
    "\n",
    "Patients staying more than 7 days show higher readmission tendency.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Action:\n",
    "\n",
    "Assign case managers to long-stay patients.\n",
    "\n",
    "Introduce post-discharge telehealth monitoring.\n",
    "\n",
    "Provide detailed discharge summaries and follow-up plans.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Patients with Multiple Diagnoses Are More Vulnerable:\n",
    "\n",
    "High diagnosis count suggests medical complexity and increased readmission risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Action:\n",
    "\n",
    "Enroll frequent visitors in chronic disease management programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Provide lifestyle and preventive care counseling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement early symptom management education.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Frequent Hospital Visitors Show Increased Risk:\n",
    "\n",
    "Patients with higher total hospital visits demonstrate healthcare dependency patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Action:\n",
    "\n",
    "Enroll frequent visitors in chronic disease management programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Provide lifestyle and preventive care counseling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement early symptom management education.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Elderly Patients Show Slightly Higher Readmission Trend:\n",
    "\n",
    "Age-based segmentation indicates older patients require more monitoring.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Action:\n",
    "\n",
    "Design elderly-specific discharge protocols.\n",
    "\n",
    "Arrange caregiver involvement during discharge.\n",
    "\n",
    "Schedule early geriatric follow-ups.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Insulin Treatment Reflects Severity:\n",
    "\n",
    "Patients receiving insulin treatment show a relatively higher proportion of readmission\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Action:\n",
    "\n",
    "Provide structured glucose monitoring plan before discharge\n",
    "\n",
    "Schedule early follow-up within 7 days\n",
    "\n",
    "Offer insulin administration counseling\n"

Implementing a structured, multi-factor risk assessment system can significantly improve discharge planning and reduce 30-day readmission rates."
